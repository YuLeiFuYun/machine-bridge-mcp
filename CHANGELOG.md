# Changelog

## 0.3.3 - 2026-07-10

### Security

- Add an exact-version npm `allowScripts` policy for the reviewed Wrangler runtime/build binaries (`esbuild@0.28.1`, `sharp@0.34.5`, and `workerd@1.20260708.1`) and explicitly deny the optional `fsevents` install script. Dependency upgrades therefore require renewed script approval.

### Changed

- Exclude the development-only Worker integration test from the published npm package while retaining it in the repository and CI.
- Add a fail-closed release command that synchronizes `main`, the version tag, the GitHub Release, and its npm tarball; block `npm publish` when those artifacts do not match.

## 0.3.2 - 2026-07-10

### Fixed

- Keep the healthy daemon active until a replacement connection completes its authenticated `hello` handshake; enforce the candidate deadline with a Durable Object alarm so it survives WebSocket hibernation, and reject stale or non-handshaking candidates without disrupting the active connection.
- Send the candidate acknowledgement before closing the previous daemon, expire failed acknowledgements, clean up duplicate authenticated sockets on subsequent handshakes, and reject pre-handshake messages without changing active tool metadata.

## 0.3.1 - 2026-07-10

### Security

- Replace reversible unsalted source-address hashes used for OAuth registration limits and password throttling with deployment-keyed HMAC identifiers; stop persisting User-Agent-derived identities, remove legacy unsalted identifiers during store migration, and fail closed if no identity key is configured.

### Fixed

- Preserve timeout escalation after the direct child exits so a process-group `SIGKILL` still removes descendants that ignore `SIGTERM`; add a regression test for the orphan-process boundary.
- Replace legacy unsalted source-identity hashes with deployment-keyed HMAC identifiers, prune legacy stored identifiers, and add integration coverage for registration quotas and login throttling.

## 0.3.0 - 2026-07-10

### Security

- Confine filesystem tools to the canonical workspace by default; add explicit `--unrestricted-paths` opt-in and symbolic-link escape protection.
- Make `write_file` bounded and atomic, reject symbolic-link/non-regular destinations, and enforce optimistic hashes consistently.
- Add recursive log-field and token redaction, control-character neutralization, owner-only service logs, and bounded log trimming.
- Harden OAuth with strict PKCE/resource/client/redirect validation, validated client disclosure on the consent page, password-failure throttling, bounded dynamic registration, per-source and per-client limits, inactive-client cleanup, strict HTTP methods/UTF-8 handling, and security response headers.
- Minimize unauthenticated and relay metadata disclosure: remove workspace name/path hash/process ID from the daemon handshake, reduce default observability sampling, and bind pending calls to their originating daemon socket.
- Bound Worker/daemon request sizes and concurrency; serialize OAuth mutations; isolate WebSocket generations; serialize per-workspace startup/deploy/rotation operations; terminate timed-out or disconnected child processes and bound Wrangler subprocesses.

### Changed

- Raise the minimum Node.js version to 22 because the current Wrangler release no longer runs on Node 20; require the installed Wrangler dependency instead of falling back to an implicit network `npx` execution.
- Remove the experimental local OpenAI-compatible `/v1` API and MCP sampling proxy.
- Detect nested Git repositories for `git_status` and `git_diff`, while disabling repository-configured external diff, text conversion, and filesystem-monitor hooks for bridge Git operations.
- Use atomic local state/config writes, bounded corrupt-state backups, strict adoption/migration of dedicated state roots, and guarded state-root deletion during uninstall, including refusal while active daemon/startup locks remain.
- Reject unknown, duplicate, malformed, and command-inapplicable CLI options; fix boolean options consuming positional workspaces.
- Verify the expected Worker version before accepting a deployment hash.
- Reduce the default Worker request-body limit to 8 MiB; bound command length, directory results, recursive traversal, and path-result payloads; provide exact-origin CORS while rejecting implicit loopback browser origins.
- Update Wrangler to 4.110.x, TypeScript to 5.9.x, and Node type definitions to the supported Node 22 API line.

### Tests and documentation

- Expand self-tests across path boundaries, symlinks, writes, UTF-8, nested Git, environment isolation, locking, CLI parsing, state recovery/removal guards, logging, service logs, and Worker hardening invariants.
- Add a live local Worker OAuth/MCP integration test, verified Node 22/24 compatibility, a Worker build dry-run, dependency audit, security policy, and architecture document.

## 0.2.5

- Previous release.
